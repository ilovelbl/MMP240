                <h3>The Red Balloon</h3>

                <p>The Red Balloon (French: Le Ballon rouge) is a 1956 fantasy featurette directed by French filmmaker Albert Lamorisse.[1] The thirty-four minute short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a <em>sentient</em>, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the Ménilmontant neighbourhood of Paris.</p>

                <p>Director: Albert Lamorisse</p>

                <h2>The White Mane</h2>

                <p>In the Camargue, France, ranchers go after wild horses led by a leader, "White Mane," which escapes capture time after time. A small boy who witnesses the horse's furious fight for its freedom makes friends with the horse after the trackers supposedly give him up to whomever can capture him. They change their minds when they see the boy has tamed him and take off after the horse again, with the boy on his back. Both boy and horse, fed up with the continual fight for freedom and peace, and the duplicity of men, head out to sea as the men plead with the boy to turn back. (Winner of the Cannes Grand Prize in category in 1953.) </p>

                <h2>Three Colors: Blue (French: Trois couleurs: Bleu)</h2>

                <p>Blue is a 1993 French drama film written, produced, and directed by the acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski. Blue is the first of three films that comprise The Three Colors Trilogy, themed on the French Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity; it is followed by White and Red. According to Kieślowski, the subject of the film is liberty, specifically emotional liberty, rather than its social or political meaning.

White is about equality, with the film depicting Karol Karol, a shy man who, after being left by his wife in humiliating circumstances in Paris, loses his money, his residency, and his friends. As a deeply ashamed beggar in Warsaw, Karol begins his effort to restore equality to his life through revenge.
