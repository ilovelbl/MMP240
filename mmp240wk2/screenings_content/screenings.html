            <h2>Color Me Sci-Fi</h2>

            <h3>Creature from the Black Lagoon</h3>
            <p>Universal Pictures introduced audiences to yet another classic movie monster with this superbly crafted film, originally presented in 3-D. The story involves the members of a fossil-hunting expedition down a dark tributary of the mist-shrouded Amazon, where they enter the domain of a prehistoric, amphibious "Gill Man" -- possibly the last of a species of fanged, clawed humanoids who may have evolved entirely underwater. (Rotten Tomatoes http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004906-creature_from_the_black_lagoon/)</p>
            <p class="director">Director: Jack Arnold</p>

            <h3>Soylent Green</h3>
            <p>Richard Fleischer directed this nightmarish science fiction vision of an over-populated world, based on the novel by Harry Harrison. In 2022, New York City is a town bursting at the seams with a 40-million-plus population. Food is in short supply, and most of the population's food source comes from synthetics manufactured in local factories -- the dinner selections being a choice between Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow, or Soylent Green.</p>

            <h3>Green Slime</h3>

Afterwards they return to the staging area, a space station called Gamma 3 in orbit around the Earth. Unfortunately, a scientist from the mission has unwittingly carried a luminous-green substance on the leg of his spacesuit which quickly mutates into one-eyed, tentacled monsters with the ability to discharge lethal bolts of electricity. </p>
            <p class="director">Director: Kinji Fukasaku</p>
